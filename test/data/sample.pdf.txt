Assignment 1: Sorting, Recursions and Big O notation
General instruction to be followed strictly
1.  Do not use any global variable unless you are explicitly instructed so.
2.  Do not use Standard Template Library (STL) of C++.
3.  Use proper indentation in your code and comment.
4.Name  your  file  as<roll_no>_<assignment_no>.For  example,  if  your  roll  number  is
14CS10001  and  you  are  submitting  assignment  3,  then  name  your  file  as14CS10001_3.c
or14CS10001_3.cppas applicable.
5.Write your name, roll number, and assignment number at the beginning of your program.
6.  Make your program as efficient as possible. Follow best practices of programming.
7.  Submit your program on Moodle before deadline.  Submissions by email or any other means will
NOT be considered for evaluation.
In this assignment you generate arrays of numbers based on known functions and then sort each
array in the fastest way possible.
First, we define a new sorting technique. Thef(·)-Combined Sorting technique is as follows:
▷If the sizenof the input arrayCis more thanf(n)thenCis broken into 2 halvesC[0 . . .
n
2
−1]and
C[
n
2
. . .n−1]. Each ofC[0 . . .
n
2
−1]andC[
n
2
. . .n−1]are recursively sorted usingf(·)-Combined
Sorting. Finally, the sorted subarraysC[0 . . .
n
2
−1]andC[
n
2
. . .n−1]are merged by a linear time
subroutine.
▷Ifn⩽f(n)then Bubble Sort is used to sort the arrayC.
Next, consider the two recursive functionsT
1
andT
2
:
T
1
(1) =2,T
1
(2) =1
T
1
(n) =T
1
(n−1) −2T
1
(n−2)forn >2
T
2
(1) =2,T
2
(2) =1
T
2
(n) =T
2
(n−1) −T
2
(n−2)forn >2
These are the steps of your program:
1.  Takenas input from the user.
2.  Populate ArrayAby running functionT
1
for inputs{1, 2, . . . ,n}.  ArrayBshould be populated by
running functionT
2
for inputs{1, . . . ,n}.
3.  Select anf(·)such that the running time off(·)-Combined sort onnelements isO(nlogn).
4.  Sort ArrayAwithf(·)-Combined sort technique, for a proper selection off(·).
1

5.  Sort ArrayBwith the sorting technique amongst Bubble sort, Insertion Sort, Merge sort, Bucket
sort, andf(·)-Combined Sort (for some appropriatef(·)) that will have the fastest worst case run-
ning time.
6.  Output the arraysAandBbefore and after sorting.
Submit a single .c or .cpp file. Your code should get compiled properly by gcc or g++ compiler.
Sample Output
Input a value for n: 6
The unsorted array A: 2 1 -3 -5 1 11
The sorted array A: -5 -3 1 1 2 11
The unsorted array B: 2 1 -1 -2 -1 1
The sorted array B: -2 -1 -1 1 1 2
